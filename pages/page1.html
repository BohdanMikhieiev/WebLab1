She is the only child of the White Whistle <b class="bold-text">Lyza, the Annihilator</b>. When she was two, her mother began her <b class="bold-text">Last Dive to the bottom of The Abyss</b>.

                    <p>Her dream is to become a White Whistle, a legendary type of Delver, and explore the depths of <b class="bold-text">The Abyss</b> with her group in order to learn its many secrets and to find her mother</p><br>
                    <p><b class="bold-text">Riko</b> is a short girl with a plain face and green eyes. For much of the series, she had been depicted with long blonde hair styled in two pigtails, at one point being braided. In more relaxed environments, she will sometimes wear her hair in a ponytail. In <b class="bold-text">The Village of Iruburu</b>, she cuts her hair short in exchange for <b class="bold-text">Value</b>. In doing so, she ends up with a haircut which greatly resembles that of her father, <b class="bold-text">Torka</b>. She is rarely seen without her glasses, lenses made from crystals that offer no optical benefit but mysteriously prevent her from experiencing headaches.</p>

It was so painful and agonizing. I was lost. I didn't know or understand what I was anymore. I even forgot how to speak. I was so scared, I just kept crying"</b>
