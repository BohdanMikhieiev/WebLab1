Possessing vast knowledge of The Abyss (its ecosystem, vegetation, and even the use of the medicines), <b class="bold-text">Nanachi</b> is currently a member of <b class="bold-text">Hello Abyss</b>, on a journey to the bottom of The Abyss. Their gender is ambiguous.</p><br>
                    <p>Most of the time, <b class="bold-text">Nanachi</b> is cool and reserved, keeping their distance emotionally and physically. Their attitude often borders on sarcastic or even cynical. However, behind this mask, <b class="bold-text">Nanachi</b> hides a kind and gentle soul, capable of deep compassion and selfless devotion. They are also quite bashful when complimented, seen in their reaction to being called "fluffy". They also express discomfort at being petted, especially by <b class="bold-text">Reg</b>. When still human, <b class="bold-text">Nanachi</b> appears to have been more timid.</p>
