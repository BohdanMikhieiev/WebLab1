                    <p><b class="bold-text">Faputa</b> is the final child of <b class="bold-text">Irumyuui</b> and is referred to as <b class="bold-text">"Princess of the Narehate"</b> by the inhabitants of <b class="bold-text">The Village of Iruburu</b> within the <b class="bold-text">6th Layer of The Abyss</b>. She is described by <b class="bold-text">Majikaja</b> as <b class="bold-text">"the embodiment of Value"</b>, and is highly regarded by the <b class="bold-text">Narehate</b> of the village. While the citizens of the village are unable to leave it, conversely, <b class="bold-text">Faputa</b> is unable to enter. She can speak both the language of <b class="bold-text">Iruburu</b> and the language of the Delvers. She is currently attached to <b class="bold-text">Riko's delving squad, Hello Abyss</b>.</p> <br>
                    <p><b class="bold-text">Faputa's</b> face, upper arms, and upper torso are dark in color. Her hair is long and feathery. Fluffy white fur covers her rabbit-like ears, forearms, legs, and lower body, starting at her hips. One of <b class="bold-text">Faputa's</b> most noticeable traits is her four arms. On each of her hands are 3 large red claws, which act as fingers, with the forth and fifth folded away. Furthermore her folded away fingers have hidden delicate talons with sensing organs that function similar to the sense of smell. Red claw like protrusions are also on her hair, her knees, and the ends of her feet, similar to hooves.</p><br>
                    <p><b class="bold-text">Faputa</b> appears to be quite unstable and unreasonable, displaying a wild behavior that makes her comparable to a beast due to her being the embodiment of <b class="bold-text">Irumyuui's</b> regrets. She speaks in a simplistic and primitive manner, referring to herself in third person, and communicating only with short sentences that are sometimes hard to understand. She is very possessive and seemingly quite jealous, claiming <b class="bold-text">Reg</b> to be her property entirely, and feels entitled to examine him thoroughly without any indication of shame or restraint. She seemed a bit shaken when <b class="bold-text">Reg</b> failed to remember her, and grew upset when Reg said he wanted to spend time with <b class="bold-text">Riko</b> and <b class="bold-text">Nanachi</b> rather than her.</p>

Your mouths, you speak in the same tongue my mother did and spit out prayers. Faputa will not forgive those mouths. Faputa will not forgive your forms. You desecrated my mother to selfishly save your own skins. Faputa will not forgive your lives, which have continued for too long. Faputa will not forgive your wishes, your joy, your sorrow, your passions. Faputa will not let any of that continue. Faputa will never forgive your existence until you are dust, scraped and disregarded. Faputa was born so this will not be forgotten. You know not how Faputa has longed for this day. Faputa will allow you no time to prepare. Faputa will eradicate you.</b>
